# PUI2017 HW 5.

I did the work by myself follow Prof. Bianco's example and with the help of google.

## Assignment 1: Test the Z test: 

I generated N samples from Poisson distribution. Calculated and showed that the distribution of z statistics follows standard normal distribution.

## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit

I used 1) KS 2) AD 3) KL 4) Pearson's chisq tests to show that with the increase of n for a Binomial distribution and Î» for a Poisson distribution, it becomes harder to distinguish from the Gaussian (Normal) distribution. The results are discussed.

## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP

Thanks for Yukun explained the meaning of weights in WLS function to me.

In this assignment, I plotted scatter plots to show the relationship between different variables.

I used linear regression to fit the number of mass shootings per person as a function of average total all civilian firearms per person.
