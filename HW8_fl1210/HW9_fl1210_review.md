In the code author specifies that size of dots corresponds to the number of trips started from the station, however this was not mentioned anywhere on the figure itself. Also as sizes of dots are indistinguishable at this scale, it would be more clear to have a close up look at the area, where top 50 stations are concentrated.

Alternatively, one can use the “heatmap” to indicate the difference in bicycle usage by stations locations. It would be interesting to see if there are bike station which are next to each other, but have very different popularity (high contrast on the heatmap), and analyze the reasons behind.
 
The title and caption have to be in the figure and not in the Markdown file, to ensure consistent font style and size.
Since map represents the whole Manhattan borough, latitude and longitude values are not helpful in distinguishing locations of stations.
 
The figure is based on the data for only one winter month. Popularity of certain bike stations is very likely to change due to weather conditions (not all stations will have roof coverage and regularly snowplowed roadways). It will be more representative to use an average number of trips during a longer period of time (several months or year), or alternatively the title of the figure could be changed to “The most popular bike stations in Winter”.
